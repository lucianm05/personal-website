The project consists of a game in which an RGB code together with 6, 8 or 10 cards (depending on the chosen difficulty) with different colors are generated randomly.

The player must guess which color the card matches the generated RGB code.

The player has 7, 6 or 5 lives (depending on the chosen difficulty). Every time a wrong card is chosen, the user loses a life. If the right one is chosen, the player gets a life. When 0 lives are left, game over is declared.
