The project consists of an user-friendly e-commerce platform with a pleasant and responsive design, which allows users to save their addresses, send orders, change their personal data. Administrators can add, modify or delete products.

To create this project I used personal resources.

Tech stack: EJS, Sass, Bootstrap, JavaScript for the Front-end, Node.js Express.js, MySQL, Sequelize for the Back-end. The application includes validations for user input and protection against CSRF attacks.
