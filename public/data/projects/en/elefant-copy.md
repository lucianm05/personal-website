The application is an imitation of the main page on elefant.ro. Everything related to the design belongs to elefant, except for the different icons that come from different sources, mentioned in a file that can pe found in the source code.

I thought it was a good exercise to learn better how to work with NextJS and to develop my fullstack skills, especially frontend.
The main knowledge gained from the development of this application are:
* accesibility
* page speed
* page layout
* slider with images, build from scratch, without any third-party packages
* many features offered by NextJS.

The data used on the paged is mainly entered dynamically, from a non-relational database in JSON format, via a REST API.

The application is a Progressive Web App and can be installed on any device.

After testing with Lighthouse, the average score was 100 points, both on desktop and mobile. The test was done through Google Chrome, using an incognito page.

Tech stack: React, NextJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, SCSS.
